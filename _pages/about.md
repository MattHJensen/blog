The [Policy Simulation Library](http://pslmodels.org) (PSL) is a collection of models and other software for public-policy decisionmaking.
PSL is developed by independent projects that meet standards for transparency and accessibility.
The PSL community encourages collaborative contribution and makes the tools it develops accessible to a diverse group of users.[^1]
